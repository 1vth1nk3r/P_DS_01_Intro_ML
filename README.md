# Predicting the most suitable plan for mobile users
The project from the Introduction to Machine Learning sprint of the Practicum DS course.

## Description
Here we have a dataset of Megaline users who have already changed to the new plans. We want to build a model for choosing the most suitable subscription plan for switching. 

Since we've already cleaned the data, there won't be much data preprocessing; only data types change. So we could proceed straight to developing models.

## Conclusion
Using the provided data, we built a DecisionTreeClassifier that predicts the best option with an accuracy of 0.793.
